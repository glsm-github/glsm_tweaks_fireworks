# Glsm's Tweaks - Fireworks

A Minecraft Resource Pack that tweaks the visuals of firework rockets.

Fireworks with explosions will all have the same explosion firework rocket texture.

Fireworks without explosions will have different textures depending on the flight duration, with the flight duration number added as part of the texture.
